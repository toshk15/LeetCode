Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 7, z = 4

Output: 1

Explanation:

    Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 4) in 2 steps.
    Person 2 is at position 7 and can reach Person 3 in 3 steps.

Since Person 1 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 1.

Example 2:

Input: x = 2, y = 5, z = 6

Output: 2

Explanation:

    Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 6) in 4 steps.
    Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 1 step.

Since Person 2 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 2.

Example 3:

Input: x = 1, y = 5, z = 3

Output: 0

Explanation:

    Person 1 is at position 1 and can reach Person 3 (at position 3) in 2 steps.
    Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 2 steps.

Since both Person 1 and Person 2 reach Person 3 at the same time, the output is 0.
