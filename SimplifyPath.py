Example 1:

Input: path = "/home/"

Output: "/home"

Explanation:

The trailing slash should be removed.

Example 2:

Input: path = "/home//foo/"

Output: "/home/foo"

Explanation:

Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

Example 3:

Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"

Output: "/home/user/Pictures"

Explanation:

A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

Example 4:

Input: path = "/../"

Output: "/"

Explanation:

Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

Example 5:

Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"

Output: "/.../b/d"

Explanation:

"..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.
