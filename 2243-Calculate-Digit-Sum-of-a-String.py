Example 1:

Input: s = "11111222223", k = 3
Output: "135"
Explanation: 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: "111", "112", "222", and "23".
  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
  So, s becomes "3" + "4" + "6" + "5" = "3465" after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into "346" and "5".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
  So, s becomes "13" + "5" = "135" after second round. 
Now, s.length <= k, so we return "135" as the answer.

Example 2:

Input: s = "00000000", k = 3
Output: "000"
Explanation: 
We divide s into "000", "000", and "00".
Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. 
s becomes "0" + "0" + "0" = "000", whose length is equal to k, so we return "000".
