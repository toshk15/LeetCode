Example 1:

Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

Example 2:

Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.

Example 3:

Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
