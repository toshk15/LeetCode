Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].
In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].
In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed.
