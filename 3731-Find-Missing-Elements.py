Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,5]

Output: [3]

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5]. Among these, only 3 is missing.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,8,6,9]

Output: []

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 6 and the largest is 9, so the full range is [6,7,8,9]. All integers are already present, so no integer is missing.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,1]

Output: [2,3,4]

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5]. The missing integers are 2, 3, and 4.
